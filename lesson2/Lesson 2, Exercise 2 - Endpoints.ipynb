    "In the last exercise, you trained a BlazingText supervised sentiment analysis model. (Let's call this model HelloBlaze.) You've recently learned about how we can take a model we've previously trained and generate an endpoint that we can call to efficently evaluate new data. Here, we'll put what we've learned into practice. You will take HelloBlaze and use it to create an endpoint. Then, you'll evaluate some sample data on that model to see how well the model we've trained generalizes. (Sentiment analysis is a notoriously difficult problem, so we'll keep our expectations modest.)"

    "Before we start, we're going to do preprocessing on a new set of data that we'll be evaluating on HelloBlaze. We won't keep track of the labels here, we're just seeing how we could potentially evaluate new data using an existing model. This code should be very familiar, and requires no modification. Something to note: it is getting tedious to have to manually process the data ourselves whenever we want to do something with our model. We are also doing this on our local machine. Can you think of potential limitations and dangers to the preprocessing setup we currently have? Keep this in mind when we move on to our lesson about batch-transform jobs.  "

mouth clicks, mouth noises, and background hissing\", \"In the end, if I had to get rid of all my mics and keep only one for vocals for the rest of my life, it would be the SM7B\", \" Mainly because I know I can conveniently use it anywhere, anytime, and get reliable good results\", \"EDIT 2014: Forgot to say, when you listen to mic shoot-outs on the net, often times the tip of the SM7B will be positioned the same distance as the condenser\", \" This is a problem because the SM7B's diaphragm is actually back a few inches\", \" So the condensers will be closer to the talent (or lack of talent) than the SM7B in such cases, causing the latter to sound more duck-ish, honky, un-detailed, or thin due solely to distance factors, and is thus not characteristic of the intrinsic mic color\", \" In shoot-outs where the proper distance was used, you'd be surprised how much the SM7B sounds like a good condenser\", \" It really does\", \" Of course it may be missing air (or conversely, be

\" Simply \\\"slide\\\" it into position\", \"The drawback--apart from durability issues that some reviewers have warned about (be careful not to over-tighten those set-screws!)--is that this thing is heavy\", \" Frankly, I was expecting a lightweight stand, at least compared to my old Manhasset, but if you've owned or been around the latter, the first thing you're likely to notice with the stand pictured here is a palpable, substantial addition in weight\", \" At the same time, with the moving parts and the set screws (topped by plastic, rotating, serrated wheels), the On-Stage stand doesn't give me the same amount of confidence in its durability as did the Manhasset--in other words, I'm very less likely to become careless with it and simply toss it on top of the gear-pile after a long, exhausting 4-hour gig\", \"Bottom line: the On-Stage appears to be a good value--a truly heavy-duty stand (in most respects) that'll do extremely well as a practice stand in a studio or living room

don't plan to put one of those 1000-page piano folders on the stand, there's at least one truly lightweight (albeit plastic) stand that's worked out really well for me (perhaps needless to say, some

little small\", \" $175 for a roundback is really a no brainer\", \" If your a beginner or have some playing experience you will enjoy this guitar and the value it offers\", \"This instrument might

craftsmanship, but certainly the sound it produces\", \" The Applause exceeds expectation whether it is unplugged, amplified, or even run directly through a mixer\", \" Beyond sounding comparatively spectacular, it is far more durable than perhaps any other hollow-bodied instrument on the market due to its components and design\", \" The electronics are reliable and the instrument is accessible,

\"The price here can't be beat and it's a well built item that works great\", \"I was concerned about the power buttons sticking out too much, but they take more pressure that it would seem, and there is a delay until it turns on or off, so that turned out not to be an issue\", \"I am not real hot for the color, but it's nicely made and works well, so I will live with it\", \"I especially like the little folding stand in the back, rather than having to find an old credit card\", \"I have it for more than 6 months and mostly use it for practicing with the metronome\", \" I have another tuner, which is set EADGBE, that is much easy to tune without any confusion\", \" Although this tuner has flexibility for tuning differently, it's confusing for me because it keeps changing the chord and going left & right +/-20 or more\", \" However, it's a bonus for using the tuner, and I don't have to bring all to the classes\", \" For the metronome, which is my initial purpose to purchase it, it's great and have enough adjustable calibration, 13 beats, rhythms, and tempos for practices\", \"Got this tuner/metronome as a replacement for a tuner-only model\", \" This is INCREDIBLY easy to use right out of the package\", \" The tuner function indicates clearly whether you are sharp or flat (or amazingly in tune)\", \" The metronome is easy to use and has great subdivisions (eighth notes, sixteenths,etc)\", \" For home and ensemble use, I personally couldn't ask for a better gadget for the price\", \" Very happy with it!\", \"This little box is great for metronome use\", \" It is loud and the screen is easy to see\", \" The tuner function can be a little disconcerting sometimes\", \" It seems to work ok but the display might fluctuate from G to C when tuning to G on a Bass guitar\", \" I used it to set my intonation on a new Bass and it was well worth the price I paid\", \" I would buy another one if I lost this one\", \"I really like this product as it comes complete with all functions anyone needs\", \" I just miss the \\\"mecanical\\\" click of a mechanic metronome\", \" The rest is just great\", \" i've bought a cable which allows me to connect the metronome to my line6 amp and the result is much much better\", \"I am quite pleased with this product\", \" It's relatively inexpensive, small and light weight\", \" It operates on two AA batteries (included)\", \" I use it primarily for a banjo and a guitar and the reference is easy to use and appears to be quite accurate\", \" The LED and large meter allows these old eyes to see it easily\", \" I should have ordered the CM-100 clip-on tuner at the same time (placed a separate order later) to allow to tune in a noisy music (jam or band) environment\", \" You can fine tune your tuning with the calibration settings\", \" There is also a 12 note sound generator built in for reference pitches\", \" The metronome is pretty loud for the small size\", \" I have a hearing loss, so if I can hear it, even while playing, it must be pretty good\", \" The speeds are from 40-208 BPM\", \" You can select between two modes PENDULUM STEP (Preset values, 40,42,44---88,92,96, etc) or FULL STEP which allows you to change incrementally by one (40, 41, 42---206, 207, 208, etc)\", \" Beat tap allows you change the time signature from 0-7 beats and also duplets, triplets, quadruplets and triplets and quadruplets without center beats\", \" It has a 1/8\\\" mini earphone jack for private use\", \" It is possible to use the metronome and the tuner simultaneously\", \" I bought mine from Austin Bazaar\", \" Shipping was FREE and FAST\", \" I give it five stars and recommend that you can give it serious consideration\", \"This device functions wonderful but the beeping of the metronome could be a little louder and of a more pleasant tone (sounds like a 1980's video game beep) but I am just being picky\", \" I bought this for my son and he loves it\", \"Pros: It's a good tuner, it's a good metronome, and it's a great combination package\", \" The flip-out stand on the back makes it easier to see than when it's lying flat\", \" The metronome has excellent selections of different rhythms and is easy to program\", \"Cons: the buttons on the front are raised on top of other raised areas, and it's too easy to accidentally turn the unit on\", \" The tuning sound activated once in my pocket while I was sitting in the audience at a band contest\", \" Also, unlike the CA-30 tuner, this one favors higher notes strongly over bass and makes it difficult to tune low instruments in a noisy environment\", \"Also, it quit working suddenly after about a year\", \" Other people I know who've had this tuner have complained about lack of durability\", \"Works well since I got it\", \" I didn't change battery for more than 6 months\", \"Tuner works as it should-- almost a little too precisely (it's pretty sensitive)\", \"The metronome will drive you crazy\", \" It has various beats which is a nice touch, but the sounds are horrible\", \" Think of the most sterile electronic clicks/beeps you can and then add nails-on-chalkboard for good measure\", \" There are much better sounding metronomes out there\", \" I bought this Korg for the tuner function and that's about all I'll use it for\", \"Dampit humidifiers have been around for years and years\", \" I think that I can safely say that the basic design looks to be amazingly similar to what I remember when I saw these for the first time in my university days of the late 1970s\", \" Generally, Dampits can be used over and over for years\", \" Sometimes the rubber becomes discolored, sometimes the rubber rips near the end of the Dampit, but basically this is a very workable way to maintain at least a minimum amount of humidity in and around your instrument, something that is especially important during the winter months when artificial heat zaps the humidity out of the air\", \" This is the first instrument-specific Dampit product that I've ever purchased and it seems to work exceptionally well\", \" In addition to the standard Dampit, there's a sound-hole cover\", \" In case it is not clear just how it works, the clear sound-hole cover has a short string with a loop on the end\", \" You simply attach the Dampit to the loop and it hangs inside the guitar\", \" My first impression is that it does an excellent job of keeping some needed humidity in the body of the instrument, something very important on a solid-top classical guitar\", \" I would recommend this over the standard Dampit because the sound-hole cover is so convenient (hopefully it will continue to keep me from having to fish around inside the guitar for a runaway Dampit) and seems to keep the humidity focused in an area that is especially in need of it\", \" A must have if you keep your acoustic guitar in an environment that gets much below 40-50% humidity\", \"It's hard to really describe what this pedal does- It doesn't distort, flange, echo, or produce a chorus\", \" I'd heard it described as making your amp sound like someone had thrown a blanket off of it\", \" And because words don't do an accurate job in describing it, I would have probably never pulled the trigger on one (even though they are pretty cheap as pedals go)\", \" As luck would have it, I acquired one on trade, and I have to admit that I agree with the whole blanket euphemism\", \" This stompbox helps correct the boxy sound of my Blues Jr\", \" when placed at the end of my pedaltrain- right before I run into the amp\", \" I don't feel it needs to be run on a dedicated effects loop to improve an amp's tone, though I do believe it works even better in a loop\", \" I placed it in the effects loop of both a Palomino V8 (USA/Ampeg made) and a Crate VC508 (a 5 watt USA made EL84 tube amp with Celestian speaker) and it was transformative to both amps' tone (in a great way)\", \" It does very well with single coils\", \" It's a pedal that I would leave on all the time once my tone is dialed in\", \" I don't think it works as well when I run my LP into a Jet City combo - particularly when trying to coax out subtle textures / harmonics\", \" That amp also lacks an effects loop and I imagine it would have a different effect if placed after the preamp phase\", \" I guess it's rig dependent, but it's a keeper for what it does to the sound of my Fender\", \"This is a great pedal to put at the end of your FX chain\", \" I have it as the last on my pedalboard before my GNX4\", \" It's always on & it only took me about a week to settle on how I liked it adjusted\", \" There are only two knobs & I just played around with them untill I was happy with the sound\", \" I do a lot of recording & I also checked the sound after recording\", \" Can't reccomend it enough especially considering the price\", \"I like it\", \" This is a good pedal for end of line tone adjustments\", \" Like all other pedals, it's not \\\"The Pedal\\\" (seems like you always need another one)\", \" But it does add to the other pedals in shaping your tone\", \" After you've settle on a setting you like, it adds a subtle, but noticeable addition to your sound\", \"This pedal essentialy balances out the high, mid, and low frequencies yout instrument produces\", \" I also have the software version of this effect on my DAW\", \" This pedal does a great job of giving your instrument a more balanced and full tone\", \" When I switch it on it allmost sounds like someone took a blanket off my amplifier\", \" I highly recomend this pedal for and and all musicians\", \"For those of you who are doing jangly pop stuff or real peaky, bitey blues material (think Albert Collins), this will likely add a little, and I mean A LITTLE, extra oomph to your sound\", \" It sounds like it uses a touch of reverb and a dash of the higher end of the mids to make cleans sound more sparkling\", \" But you should also be able to get the same sounds out of a Hughes and Kettner Statesman 40 or 60 watt amp, too, just running it straight\", \"To me, from what I have heard, it adds nothing to those who use a fair amount of distortion in their music\", \" It definitely doesn't add any more fatness\", \" So my overall impression is that what this box provides is the same thing that some people swear they get out of copper bracelets for their arthritis or feeling better with an increased Vitamin E regimen\", \" In other words, this is a matter of what is in your head and how suggestable you are\", \"Most musicians already use EQ and reverb and by careful tweaking of those two things you can obtain what you think you're getting out of this pedal, I think\", \"I'm not going to do any explaining about the \\\"science\\\" behind how this pedal works\", \" I'm just going to focus this review on how the pedal affects your tone\", \" This definitely isn't a boost, and it's also not an eq, the BBE sonic stomp is a uniquely functioning pedal\", \" To the ear, it serves to add clarity, depth, and body to your tone\", \" Essentially, this pedal allows you to get the most out of the tones your amp is already producing\", \"The lo contour knob doesn't \\\"increase\\\" the amount of bass produced by the amp\", \" Rather, it tightens up and generally increases the depth of the bass (and low mid) tone\", \" To the ear this may sound at first like the bass has been increased, but it hasn't\", \" You're just hearing all the bass tone that was there in the first place, that was jumbled up as the signal went from your guitar to the amp\", \"The process knob really just focuses on the treble and high mid frequencies\", \" These frequencies can often be very unpleasant and grating to hear, and the sonic stomp sort of evens and smooths out those tones so they are clearer and less harsh\", \"That's not to say that you can't dial in some very aggressive and cutting highs if you play lead metal or something; indeed, it'll make those searing lead tones even better\", \"Now, I gave this product 4 stars not because I've had any issues with it or haven't been in any way unsatisfied with it; but rather because it's really a fairly subtle effect\", \" At first I almost couldn't tell a difference between having it on and off\", \" With time I've been able to better recognize and appreciate the impact that it has on my tone, but it doesn't make a \\\"night and day\\\" difference\", \"I recommend this pedal to someone who already has a tone that you're happy with, and just want to make it even better\", \" This pedal won't make a cheap 15 watt solid- state combo sound like a tube half-stack\", \" It won't make you love your tone when you were completely unsatisfied with it before\", \"In conclusion, though I definitely wouldn't put this pedal into the \\\"must have\\\" category, it definitely improves the quality of my tone\", \" This is a pedal that I leave on all the time, as it improves both clean and distorted tones\", \"This pedal adds that \\\"I don't know what\\\" to your sound\", \"I chased a sound for years until buying this pedal - what a difference\", \"If you have great, top quality cable, quiet amps and pedal boards, shielded guitars, fresh tubes - you know the drill - you spend thousands chasing something you hear in your head - then you plug one pedal in and WHAMO!! - there it is!It was THIS pedal for me - just turn the knobs until \\\"it\\\" comes out of your speakers\", \"A must have - especially if you are playing clubs, bars or arenas - you have a pedal board - and you are looking for that sound that is gonna finally push your sound out front - give your notes clarity during leads - make overdriven chords ring\", \"I like this pedal - it's on my board - and it's never coming off\", \"Just got my stand today\", \" the QUICKEST delivery EVER with the Super Savings free shipping selected that I have ever experienced! Go go, Amazon! lulz Anyhoo, I have two banjos and a mandolin that I purchased this for\", \" I looked about for quite a bit at various sites, reviews, prices, etc, and pretty much Hercules got the best reviews everywhere (although admittedly I hadn't really wanted to shell out over 50 dollars)\", \" Yet this tri-stand really looked good with a solid general review, and I am rather tight for space overall (think trailer home size)\", \" I wanted a way to hold my instruments in one place without having to work around gig-bags or hard cases taking up limited 'living space'\", \" As it stands (figuratively and literally), the Hercules Tri-Stand does the job excellently with the two banjos\", \" All three instruments are varying heights, the resonator bluegrass banjo being the longest, and (naturally) the mandolin being the shortest, with a open back clawhammer banjo in the middle\", \"The three 'back-rest' fold outs are static, attached to a center ring, and you \\\"can\\\" adjust them independently a *little up and down*, but not to compensate for such a length difference between a bluegrass banjo and a mandolin\", \" However, the mandolin is a really lite thing, so I suspect it will be fine just hanging there by the peg head without a 'back-rest' as long as the stand isn't jostled around\", \" In my own case, aside from two rather lazy cats and pending no sudden hip-smash-oops by me, that shouldn't be an issue\", \" And of course, considering I am looking at a possible third banjo, the mandolin may just go live in its case after all\", \"Now a word about open back banjos, if you are considering this stand\", \" First off, no, I was not going to rest the coordinator rod against the 'back-rest' (just seems like a bad idea)\", \" What I ended up doing was adjusting the 'back-rests' so the resonator of the bluegrass banjo rested about an inch up from the bottom, allowing the open back to rest on the other side ON TOP of the rest, along the lip of the banjo rim, at the edge of the rest foam where it begins to curve out and down\", \" The tail-piece nut is in between the two foam pads without touching a thing\", \" Seems pretty solid in this position while still engaging the weight clamps up at the top\", \"I give it 5 stars mainly based on the excellent quality of the stand and the fact that it is the ONLY three instrument stand worth any kind of hoot I have been able to find\", \" Its not the absolute perfect thing for my own application (would need the three 'back-rests' to be independently adjustable in height for that), but overall I am extremely pleased with it\", \"If you are like me and truly value your (usually) expensive prized instruments, then you want to make sure nothing happens to them, accidentally or otherwise\", \" The Hercules stands are much much more stable than all the rest\", \" They have a better base design, and even when the stand inevitably gets bumped there is no wobbling, no worries - just make sure you lower it all the way, as it is designed to be\", \"These things are awesome\", \" Also, everything fits so perfectly on Hercules stands\", \" All of the other tri-stands lean your instruments in toward the top too much and cause the headstocks to bang together\", \" Not here, plenty of room for everything now\", \" This stand (and the double version which I also own) lets your gear hang down perfectly straight and protects it all with those very thickly padded stops you see near the base in the picture\", \" Also, the hanging gravity grasp around the neck is so sweet\", \" With all other stands I am always worried that my guitar will slide off, or if it gets bumped that it could fall out\", \" This mechanism holds it tight until you want it, and releases it very easily and naturally for you, but will not let it go while it's just sitting there\", \" Check these things out, you will not be disappointed\", \"Also, as for durability, I have used and abused my Hercules stand for years, tossing it around my car to play at different places\", \" It's been tossed, dropped, setup and stowed many times and it still looks and works just like it did when I first bought it\", \" It doesn't even have any obvious visible scratches on it (it came with a bag but I discarded it and never used it)\", \" Meanwhile, I had gone thru dozens of regular cheapo stands over the years before I bought the Herc\", \" I will only every buy Herc stands from now on\", \"This is one of the cleanest sounding mini-amps you'll find\", \" Mine has no hiss or noise through the headphones\", \" It uses JFET components which get close to a tube amp sound\", \" It does sound tinny through the 2\\\" speaker, but AM radio sounded just as bad through 2\\\" speakers\", \" I hated it at first until I plugged in a set of headphones and turned down the O\", \" Drive knob\", \" Very clean but I could get some character out of it by tweaking the guitar's volume knob\", \" Turning the O\", \"Drive knob up just a bit adds some sparkle\", \" Of course you can get really distorted sounds from the amp\", \" I'm building a speaker cab with a Jensen 6\\\" speaker just for this amp\", \" According to many reports it will drive a 1x12 cab\", \"This is 10 watt walkman size guitar amplifier\", \" The controls are Volume/ off, Tone, and overdrive\", \" It also has a headphone jack\",

switch\", \" Paint it all weird and call it a 'boutique pedal'\", \"This device works\", \" Here's what it does\", \" You plug an electric bass into the pedal's instrument input and then you can plug a second standard instrument cable into the pedal's high impedance output jack and then plug that one into a bass amp\", \" You also can connect it to a low impedance microphone preamp via the 200 Ohm low impedance XLR jack out\", \" You can use just the high-impedance output or just the XLR output or you can use them both simultaneously\", \" When the \\\"footswitch\\\" is off it functions transparently with no tonal modification at all just like a direct box\", \" When the \\\"footswitch\\\" is on an LED light activates and the tonal boost and tube emulation functions are on\", \" I put \\\"footswitch\\\" in quotes because I use fingers to push it, but leave it on all the time for my personal purpose\", \" When you insert a plug into the instrument input jack the unit powers on, so if running on battery be sure to unplug the input when not actually using it\", \"Some other functional comments about it\", \" It runs on 9 volt batteries or a 9-volt power supply\", \" I used batteries for a while but switched to an ac adapter\", \" Battery life isn't super but satisfactory\", \" Still if using it a lot, I suggest using an AC adapter\", \" When the battery starts going it sounds awful, but you could put it into bypass mode to finish the set\", \" Also when the \\\"footswitch\\\" is off and the LED is not lit, this thing functions as a straight XLR ouput direct box for anything you plug into it\", \" You could patch the output of an acoustic electric guitar or the output of an electric guitar pedal board to it and use that to feed a mixer for recording direct which is a very handy feature for the home recording hobbyist! The amp emulation and tone controls are wrong for anything other than electric bass, so just use it as a direct box with the tone/emulation circuit off for anything except bass\", \"The controls are all rotary knobs except the Ground-Lift switch which is a slide switch\", \" The controls left to right, top row to second row are: DRIVE, TREBLE, BASS, LEVEL, PRESENCE, GROUND LIFT SLIDE SWITCH and BLEND\", \"Taking each control one at a time to understand what they do is important because they are not all logically placed\", \" The DRIVE knob adjusts the amount of gain similar to cranking the input stage control of the tube preamp and here is where you can get something like the tonal thickness (or edge) of overdriven tube tone\", \" Basically this part of the circuit injects variable harmonics and some of the more pleasing distortion out there for this purpose\", \" There is no ACTIVE/PASSIVE pad switch or extra active input jack on this pedal so if you have an active bass then you will not have to turn the drive knob up as much to get the tone you want\", \" The TREBLE knob is a + or - 12db boost and cut of upper frequency tones\", \" The BASS knob is a + or - 12db boost and cut of the lower frequencies\", \" 12 o'clock is flat (or zero db boost or cut) on both the treble and bass knobs\", \" The LEVEL knob is the master volume control and all it does is control the output volume with no tonal coloration\", \" The PRESENCE knob boosts the upper frequency range harmonic content for more attack in your tone\", \" The Presence knob isn't a midrange control, but does boost the upper mids\", \" The GROUND LIFT switch only effects the XLR output jack and it should be left \\\"OFF\\\" unless you hook it up and there is hum\", \" Then you can turn the Ground Lift \\\"ON\\\" and it might help eliminate the hum issue\", \" However it is better from a safety standpoint to remedy this by eliminating the electrical ground loop conflict that is causing the hum\", \"

little bass gear, or anything else, is \\\"PERFECT\\\" these days\", \" Behringer gear has more build issues in general across most of their product line because using Chinese parts and labor is how

based on previous experience with plastic switches on stomp boxes I know not to use my size 13-D foot on it\", \" The Treble and Presence knobs on mine will generate hiss and noise when set very high

Basically I set the Treble and Presence to the point where I hear hiss start, then back off until it goes completely away because that is the functional limit\", \" Hiss is no issue in bypass mode

treble simultaneously\", \" Some people who use this pedal as a stage-tool use it as a solo or \\\"scoop\\\" switch for slap & tap solos so the presence, bass and treble boost are basically all you need for a solo switch anyway\", \"PROS: First and foremost the price is almost too good to be true when you consider the price for anything else with similar features, but keep in mind that it has

an active bass with the treble and bass boost in front of the amp\", \" It is also useful for boosting a signal in front of a longer cable run to the backline, say anything over about 18 feet\", \" For recording the XLR direct out is very useful and the XLR direct out can also be used to feed the PA at a gig if your amp doesn't have a XLR direct out\", \"How I use this device: I have my bass

don't actually understand how to properly use traditional tuners and they don't get stable tuning as a result because they use too few or too many wraps and don't string it correctly\", \" For those folks, these will elimiate the resulting \\\"pings\\\" and such\", \" But their intended purpose is to speed string changes\", \" I believe that some folks confuse locking tuners with a locking nut in that respect\", \" A locking nut quite definitely makes for more stable tuning, and that's why you always find them with Floyd Rose tremolos which are made for dive bombing\", \" But locking tuners are not really for that purpose\", \"FIT AND INSTALLATIONRegarding fit, these have 2 little pins on the backside\", \" If you are considering a replacement, make sure you get tuners that are the right size and configuration for your guitar so you don't have to drill the back of the neck, the tuner bores in the headstock, or use inserts\", \" If you want to use these but don't have the little alignment holes, Stewart Macdonald makes a small drilling jig for drilling those holes\", \" It's expensive (about $40) but not as expensive as messing up your neck or breaking the tuners when you tighten them down on ill fitting mounts\", \" It is nearly impossible to drill those alignment pin holes correctly without a jig, and even with the jig, easy to be slightly off\", \" These fit most newer FENDER stratocasters and tele's, both american and MIM and will be a drop in replacement with no muss and no fuss in most of those cases\", \"Pull one of your existing tuners out and look at it before you change\", \" If you have a squier or a knockoff you may want to measure the headstock bore and remove a tuner to look at the back mount\", \" Maybe buy and inspect, with the knowledge you might have to return them\", \" There is usually an exact fit drop in replacement locking tuner that can replace your standard tuner so if this isn't it, look for one in the same brand as what is on your guitar now\", \" Be aware different tuners also have slightly different holes bored for the main peg hole\", \"Typical neck bores for tuners (by brand) are shown on the warmoth site at [\", \"]These are the holes that warmoth uses on custom necks when fitting tuners of various brands:- For Fender/Shaller tuners, its a two step bore, with the main portion being 25/64\\\" and the rest at

inclined, have the tools, and don't mind potentially drilling additional holes in your neck, you can almost fit any tuner you want on any guitar\", \" Sometimes that means using inserts or bushings, or drilling a hole for a tiny backmount screw, or for alignment pins in different locations\", \"but the best answer is to use a tuner that is a drop-in replacement\", \"When installing, be sure to look at the height of the pegs on your old and these new tuners\", \" These are not all the same length -- they have staggered heights - 3 long and 3 shorter\", \" (I think I have also seen some sets that are 4/2 but these are 3/3\", \") Put the long ones in the E-A-D string holes, and the shorter ones in the G-B-HighE holes\", \"These replaced the stock tuners on my Squier Deluxe Stratocaster and were NOT a drop in fit\", \" There are two pegs on the tuners that didn't line up with the holes from my stock tuners in the headstock and required me to drill additional holes\", \" I was somewhat expecting this thou so no starts taken away\", \"These make string changes so easy and I love the ratio of these tuners\", \" Because they are staggered I was able to ditch the string trees as well\", \"Unfortunately, these tuners require drilling to fit my Squier Strat\", \"They look very similar but the two pins are approximately 1/16th of an inch further out from the shaft so I'm going to have to drill new holes in the headstock to use them\", \" Worse, the holes will actually touch the edge of the existing stock holes so, I'm going to have to fill them, first\", \"The quality of the

down to either this or the Gibralter, which was slightly smoother, but significantly more expensive\", \" I opted for best value without sacrificing performance or quality and am thrilled with this

some reason, is difficult to see from an angle, but that's largely an irrelevant gripe\", \"But let's be clear what a \\\"Tube Overdrive\\\" pedal is and isn't\", \" This is NOT a distortion petal

need heavy distortion to mask sloppy playing, the TS9 is not for you\", \"What it DOES do, however, is to boost the signal at the front end, which essentially results in a more dynamic done with additional gain\", \" This can result in a very midrange-heavy \\\"blues\\\" tone (Stevie Ray Vaughan used it quite a bit), or even a nice \\\"crunch\\\" overdrive tone (AC/DC) for rhythm work\", \" Some guitars use it simply to boost their signal without adding a bunch of additional gain\", \" It also works well with other distortion pedals for that purpose\", \"Long story short - the Ibanez TS9 Tubescreamer really is one of the more versatile pedals you will use - just don't expect it to create every range of sounds you need right out of the box\", \" For a cheaper alternative, consider Digitech's surprisingly good \\\"Bad Monkey\\\" overdrive pedal, which is half the price and gives you more control over tone\", \" I've also compared this to BOSS's BD-2 Blues Driver, which is an excellent, but very different style of overdrive\", \" (The BD-2 has a much hotter output and is more aggressive; the Tubescreamer is more subtle and works in the midrange while retaining your underlying clean tone and responding to picking style)\", \" If you start with a good amp and guitar setup, the Tubescreamer will sound great\", \" It won't completely transform your tone, but it will give your current tones a boost, make those solos really sing and those rhythm chords really crunch\", \"I bought this unit for a friend, and I could compare with others overdrives I already have\",

mistaken both the TS9 and the TS7 can be modded to this circuit with less than 25 cents in parts and about 15 minutes of your time\", \" If this pedal came in under the $100 mark it would be more deserving of five stars\", \" I really hate to burst anyone's bubble but SRV's tone was really in his fingers\", \" And so is yours ;)\", \"Years ago I owned an original edition TS808; I loved that pedal and used it for years on stage\", \" Eventually I sold it many years later, but I always missed that pedal, so I decided to give this reissue a try\", \" My verdict: Awesome - It sounds just like I remember\", \" The TS808 just has that 'certain something' that really brings out a nice smooth overdrive sound, especially when it's to enhance the overdrive sound you may already have\", \"I have only used one of these with a hybrid tube amp and a solid state but I hear that it will work with either tube or solid state amplifiers\", \" It really gives my amplifier a warm overdriven sound\", \" This pedal can be used to boost your guitar sound during solos or certain guitar parts\", \" This pedal has three preamp settings: Ts9, Hot, +, and Turbo\", \" It's great for solos and warm blues or rock rhythm guitar\", \" One nice thing about this is it responds well to how soft or hard you pluck the strings\", \" For example: if you set on the \\\"Turbo\\\" setting and pick with your fingers it will clean up nicely\", \" If you pluck hard it will make a smooth distorted sound\", \" If you want a metal sound, then I recommend the Metal Zone by Boss/Roland\", \"BOSS MT-2 Metal Zone Overdrive Distortion Pedal\", \"To start, as the full name of this pedal would indicate, this pedal is for tube amps\", \" I can't comment on how it'll sound for a hybrid, and my experience is that it's definitely not for solid state\", \" Distortion pedals go much better with solid state\", \" Further, tube screamers aren't meant to take your tube amp from clean to high gain; again, that's what a distortion pedal will do\", \" Tube screamers in general are designed to drive your tubes a little harder,and are most commonly used as a solo boost\", \" Tube screamers are in the category of \\\"overdrive\\\" pedals, and like the name would indicate, they're meant add a little extra \\\"over\\\" an already \\\"driven\\\" amp, but in a more natural, smooth, organic way then a distortion pedal would\", \"HOWEVER, the Ibanez TS-9dx does more than your typical tube screamer\", \" The extra knob that switches between ts9, +, hot, and turbo mode adds a whole lot of tone and use options\", \" Let me expound:I play hard rock and metal through a Bugera 1990 head (basically a Marshall JCM 900)and cab with celestion vintage 30 speakers\", \" While that amp does have a fair amount of gain and bass on tap, it's not quite enough to accurately get more modern tones unaided\", \" A standard Ibanez TS-9 or some other knock-off tube screamer will not be able to get an amp like mine into more modern, heavier tones, because standard tube screamers also slightly cut bass and add some mids, again, to help solos cut through the mix\", \" But the extra knob on the ibanez ts9dx solves this problem\", \" By switching to +, hot, or turbo mode, the pedal adds bass and a little extra gain incrementally\", \" I like the \\\"+\\\" setting the best\", \" So the way I use this pedal is that I'll set my amp for my standard crunchy rhythm tone with the gain on the amp already fairly high\", \" Then, for the songs that utilize a little heavier sound, I'll kick on my ts9dx, with the drive pretty low (9 o'clock), volume at 12 o'clock, tone about 1 o'clock, and + mode\", \" With these settings it increases the bass and general thickness of my tone, and adds a little gain and volume\", \" So it's basically like adding another channel to my amp\", \"I will add one detail that might make or break this pedal for you: tubescreamers in general, and certainly this Ibanez ts-9dx, add mid-range to your tone automatically\", \" And you can't dial it out\", \" The regular ts-9 mode adds some low mids, and a little more high mids\", \" The other modes add more low mids in particular, which in part contribute to the overall \\\"thickness\\\" to the tone, which can be great\", \" But if you're after a scooped mid sound, say for metal, then I would only recommend this pedal as a solo boost, where the mids will help cut through the mix\", \"In conclusion, it's probably safe to say that most people who buy tubescreamers are probably playing blues of some sort and are just looking to boost their volume and maybe add a little dirt\", \" And yes, this pedal will do that\", \" So will the BBE greenscreamer, behringer tube overdrive,mxr distortion plus, Boss SD-1, digitech bad monkey, or several other ibanez tube screamer pedal variations\", \" But by adding the turbo-mode options, the Ibanez TS-9dx will work for the hard rock and metal players (depending on the exact style) in a way that these plethora of other options won't\", \"Consider the distortion sound of Cream, the Doors, and ZZ top\", \" That buzzy, psychedelic type sound is what this pedal does\", \" Unfortunately, that's about all it does\", \" However, if you want to have the perfect \\\"break on through\\\" guitar intro sound, this is absolutely the pedal for you\", \" Quality-wise it's awesome, and if I needed that sound I would definitely own one again\", \" I got rid of mine to purchase some other gear that served a wider variety of functions, and honestly I haven't missed it, because I'm not in a Doors cover band or anything\", \"If you're not familiar with EHX's signature distortion/fuzz pedal the Big Muff, please go to a guitar shop somewhere and try one out\", \" Describing its sound with words helps, but doesn't really do it justice\", \" It definitely owns its own sonic territory and after playing through one for a while you'll see why so many guitarists of so many fields have one on hand\", \"They're one of my very favorite effects, honestly\", \" So for this review, I'm going to focus more on how the Little Big Muff stacks up against the other models\", \"For starters, this version takes care of ALL of the common complaints regarding the NYC reissue\", \"1\", \" Its true bypass\", \"2\", \" Its much smaller (not super tiny like a Boss, but a little slimmer than, say, the wider MXR pedals like the Phase 100)\", \"3\", \" It uses a normal 9v adapter jack (thank you, finally!)\", \"4\", \" It sounds better\", \"Yes, it indeed SOUNDS better than the NY Reissue\", \" Some have complained about the buzzy sound the recent reissue has\", \" This one is smoother\", \" Not as creamy as the Russians, but it also doesn't suck tone like that one does either\", \" Its a touch higher gain than both the Russians and the Tone Wicker versions, but all in all it absolutely is a Big Muff\", \"So if you're in the market for one of these, and you don't want the options the Tone

chance and bought it\", \" Well, the back of my guitarr&oacute;n bulges out like a blowfish, so the neck could not lay back into the upper fork, but it turned out that when this stand is fully

fairly easy (although the instructions were downright cryptic)\", \" The adjustability is wonderful\", \" And the kit looks phenomenal out of the box\", \" That being said, one of my toms is nowhere near as responsive as the rest of them (I'll soon contact the company for a replacement), the cymbals are not intuitive to strike placement (you only get the secondary cymbal tone when you strike it very hard, and even then it's no guarantee), and I'm guessing, due to their close proximity to each other and the sensitivity of the pads, the snare often activates when I strike the hi-hat\", \" At first glance, the different tone kits don't bring much to the table\", \" But there is a wide range of personalization available when you begin to dig deeper into the controls\", \" To a small extent, I've even been able to cover up the less-than-responsive tom by lowering the volume on all the other pieces\", \" My only other complaint is that the bass drum doesn't bring much to the table\", \" It

change the sound and/or volume produced\", \" The impression I get is that most electronic drum sets have some kind of problem or another, so it seems to be whether the problem(s) are something you can live with or not\", \" Also, you can't play with the same nuance and control as an acoustic set, but for the price it goes a long way to making it seem real enough that I can enjoy it and feel

encounter until I become really accomplished\", \" One is that when playing the snare rim shot and either the hi-hat or tom 1 simultaneously, one or the other will not trigger a sound to occur about

experiment with different instruments & write more about the quality later\", \")That said, there is only one piezo element, unlike a K&K; pickup, for example\", \" So it is limited in giving you optimal sound, no matter where it is placed\", \" Also, in case you cannot tell from the image, the soldering connection and wires are exposed on the jack, so it can only be used inside your instrument, which means drilling a hole\", \"So i decided to amplify my Martin Dreadnaught (a really, really nice acoustic guitar)\", \" I didn't want to spend a lot if it just wouldn't sound good

soundhole pickup\", \"ATTACHING ITUnfortunately the narrow portion of the barrel is not long enough to fit through the end/tail block; and I didn't want to drill a new hole in my not-so-cheap guitar just to test out a relatively cheap pickup\", \"So I attached the pickup in the regular position inside the body behind the bridge, and just ran the cable out from the sound hole\", \" The jack is held onto the pickguard with some scotch outdoor mounting tape (which is kind of like really strong gum, it can be removed without leaving sticky residue); which holds it in place well enough to plug in a cable and move around as long as I don't jerk the guitar quickly\", \"SOUND QUALITYI plugged it into my cheap, regular guitar amp, and whoa! The package mentions two locations you can place the pickup, and because I needed to run it through the sound hole, I could only place it where more treble is picked up\", \" So I have to compensate on my amp by turning down the treble to 7 or lowerBecause the pickup is a transducer, no electrical feedback/interference is picked up, so the sound will be very clear and crisp\", \" It would probably sound even better on an amp with better electric shielding; the only noise I get even at max gain, max input volume, is from the amp itself, heard with every instrument I plug into it if I turn the master volume up too high\", \"Another thing to consider is that transducers pickup vibrations, so it won't pick up sound when placed a millimeter away from the guitar body, but will when touching it\", \" So with that in mind, the pickup will strongly output every sound you make to the guitar body; like it brushing up against your body, a zipper hitting the guitar, your fingers sliding on the strings etc\", \"This pickup is pretty good at lower volumes\", \" But it becomes a feedback nightmare at higher volume\", \" The pickup is very, over sensitive\", \"Also, spend some time where exactly you place the pickup, it makes a big difference!

and pattern knobs are rather loose, allowing for lateral and vertical as well as the expected rotating movement\", \" The knobs turn effortlessly but not with the ball-bearing smoothness one might associate with ultra expensive professional equipment\", \" There's the slightest hint of resistance at one point in the gain control's circular movement, but it's not at the 12 o'clock position, so

above, the lack of a foot switch to change between clean and dirty tones will have to be solved by either running a dirt box in front of the amp, or as previously stated, running one channel clean and one channel dirty and us an A/B switch to go between them\", \" As far as other effects, I really like what it does to my TC Electronic Flashback Delay and Corona Chorus\", \" Note that there is a

much better; I love the tone that I can get, the tube warmth is just sooo much more soulful than the sterile sound from a solid state amp, it's feature rich, and takes pedals well\", \" The other two

the AC15C1 is actually a better blues amp\", \"(Opinions vary of course)I only have a couple is \\\"wishes\\\" as they're not really gripes\", \" One is the stock reverb\", \" It's really overboard in

speaking of foot switches do yourself a favor and get an a/b/y switch for this\", \" It allows you to switch between the top boost/normal channels and also allows you to run through both channels at

what\", \" It sounds very nice, especially for the low price\", \"The amp's overdrive is very rich, with lots of harmonic overtones the higher you crank the master volume\", \" I cranked it to 10 in

channels\", \" I've opted to just use the \\\"Normal\\\" channel and push it with a Joyo Ultimate Drive pedal, which by the way, is the most impressive $40 overdrive pedal you'll ever hear\", \" That overdrive does not interfere with the Vox tone at all\", \" I used it this morning with a stratocaster loaded with DiMarzio HS series pickups and the Joyo pedal pushing the amp, and it was classic Vox

\\\"hiss\\\" problems with this amp, which were usually solved by installing a better set of preamp tubes\", \" Mine did not have this problem\", \" Actually, I thought it did, and I was certainly getting a loud hiss out of it for a while before I realized that it was the way I had the amp set up: As I stated earlier, this is a 2-channel amp (Normal and Top Boost), but which one you're using is determined by which input you plug your guitar into\", \" I was plugged into the Normal channel, and didn't realize that the Top Boost volume was dimed and that's where the hiss was coming from\", \" I just shut that volume completely off since I was not using the Top Boost channel anyway\", \" Problem solved\", \"I'm amazed at how such an affordable amp can sound so nice\", \" I've owned

First, a quick word about compression\", \" The easiest way to describe compression is that smooths and sustains the level and intensity of your guitar's pure tone\", \" When you play an uncompressed guitar signal, you can experience annoying volume swells if you strum too aggressively\", \" On the other side of the problem, you may want to use strummed chords or arpeggiated sequences for a continuous \\\"ringing\\\" effect, but find that the individual notes die out too soon\", \" A quality compressor pedal takes those extremes and normalizes them\", \" It also can \\\"sustain\\\" the notes by boosting the levels of individual chords or notes when they would otherwise fade away, depending on the settings\", \"BUILD QUALITY - If there are complaints to be had about the MXR Custom Comp, they aren't related to durability\", \" MXR pedals, like BOSS pedals, are built with heavy-duty metal, yet the pedal is surprisingly light with the battery removed\", \" Unlike BOSS pedals, the switch is in the form of a metal button that \\\"clicks\\\" when you press it\", \" My understanding from veteran MXR users is that the switch is very reliable and long-lasting\", \" In my case, however, I intend on having the thing on all the time, so this is not a major concern anyway\", \"One gripe with the pedal is the accessibility of the battery and internal \\\"Attack\\\" control\", \" The pedal has knobs for Output (volume) and Sensitivity (basically, amount of compression)\", \" The \\\"Attack\\\" knob, which is found on some rival compressors, has to do with the degree of \\\"pick attack\\\" sound you want when you first hit the note, and whether the sound comes on aggressiveness or more subtly\", \" But on the MXR Custom Comp, you need to remove the back plate (4 Phillips screws) and adjust the Attack know with a screwdriver\", \" You also need to remove the back plate to get to the battery, though I've switched to a power adapter/daisy chain (OneSpot) for my pedals anyway\", \" So, yes, it's an inconvenience, but with this type of effect, it's not like you would want to adjust the Attack the way you would mess with Tone or Gain on a distortion pedal\", \" I consider this also to be a non-issue\", \"TONE/SOUND QUALITY -

iRiffport and the Jam\", \" I recently purchased, and then returned, the iRiffport\", \" I am very pleased that I purchased the Apogee Jam as a replacement\", \" Here are the reasons why:1) The connector on the iRiffport (the one that goes into the iPad) is not a strong connection at all; it feels as though it could disconnect at any time\", \" I have a stand to put my iPad on when jamming such that the iPad is in landscape mode, so the cord feels as though it will come out of moved the wrong way\", \" With the Apogee Jam, the connector is just like the iPad's connector, except it ALSO has the \\\"prongs\\\" that come out of it, securing the connector into the iPad\", \" To remove the connector from the iPad, you need to squeeze the buttons on the connector to make the \\\"prongs\\\" go in so it can be removed\", \"very, very secure\", \" I use the \\\"Gumdrop\\\" case on my iPad, which has a flap that goes over the charging port when not being used\", \" This flap feels pretty tawt when it is open while the charging port is being used\", \" IMPORTANT: if you have such an iPad case, like me, I certainly feel that the Jam will provide a much more secure connection to your iPad over the iRiffport\", \" In fact, the structure of the iRiffport connector was so large, that I felt that it did not fit well through my case\", \" On the other hand, the Jam's connector is the same small size as the iPad's original connector\", \" This is also something to consider if you intend to use your iPad in portrait mode on a stand with the connector on the bottom of the iPad\", \"2) Probably the largest reason I prefer the Jam over the iRiffport: you can hear sound directly from the iPad\", \" With the iRiffport, you MUST use headphones or attach external speakers\", \" I tried headphones with the iRiffport and playing the guitar was very awkward\", \" Nonetheless, with the Jam, I could attach headphones or external speakers to the iPad if I chose to do so\", \" I wanted something that could make my iPad an amplifier for easy mobility around my house, without having to purchase another amplifier or external speakers\", \" With the Jam, I have this\", \"3) The Jam has a gain meter (i\", \"e\", \", an LED) and a gain control\", \" The iRiffport does not\", \" When not being used to measure the level of the incoming audio, the LED lets you know if you are connected to the iPad, but not to any software (blue light), or if you are connected to the iPad AND to a software application (green light)\", \" There are no batteries needed for the Jam or the iRiffport\", \"4) I personally like that I can use my own guitar cord with the Jam\", \" If the cord breaks, I simply replace the cord, not my iPad connection device\", \" The iRiffport uses its own cord, and the connection to my guitar did not feel as strong as my \\\"normal\\\" guitar cable I used with the Jam\", \"5) Although a fairly minor point, it is nice to know that the Jam is advertised by Apple (look at their website and their Garageband video)\", \" And, since I have Garageband on my iPad, I was pleased to see that the advertising material on the Jam states

Only problem is the strings\", \" Sting one \", \" play's &#34;dead&#34; meaning it will not stay in-tune\", \" Not sure if the knot is slipping or it is the string type that is the problem\", \" Have another set of strings [better quality] and will try that set soon\", \"This is a great package for beginners\", \" I never played a ukelele before but I learned to play guitar many years ago\", \" I have no idea on how to tune a ukelele so I downloaded an app called \\\"Easy Ukelele\\\" available in Amazon and Google Playstore for free\", \" That is the only ukelele tuner I can recommend for beginners as it actually listens to your Ukelele and tells you when your device is in tune\", \" I purchase this as gift to my son's 5th birthday that is coming up in 2 weeks so I have not yet preview the DVD and CD that came with it\", \" I did however, checked and played with the ukelele while my son is at school, sleeping or playing outside to make sure that it is properly working when he open the box on his birthday and before the return period runs out\", \"My Review:1\", \" The Package: The box comes with the Ukelele, Beginners Manual, DVD, CD, carry pack, and 2 extra set of Ukelele strings\", \" Tuner is not included so I advise that you either buy a tuner or download the \\\"Easy Ukelele\\\" app I mentioned above\", \"2\", \" The Ukelele: The Ukelele looks and feels decent\", \" It has a sticker that says made in china\", \" It comes pre-strung but it is out of tune\", \" I tuned it using the app I downloaded but it would not hold a tune\", \" It is very bad that the sting gets out of tune before you even finish tuning all the other strings\", \" Basically, the ukelele sounded like an out of tuned toy when you first take it out of the box and even after a few adjustments\", \" Since the string is nylon, I gave it a chance to settle\", \" I would tune it really sharp and leave it alone for at least 10 minutes or more then pick it up and strum on it and push the string from side to side\", \" I actually position the tuner pegs horizontally so I can see if it is moving when the string gets more tension\", \" The tuner pegs stays in place so I know that the problem is with the string\", \" It could be that the string included is a cheap one\", \" After doing this a few time on day 1, I was able to play my first song I grabbed from the book (Clementine)\", \" But after 1 song, you have to tune it again\", \" I just repeat what I did for the next 2 days, tuning it sharp and leaving it alone and play songs\", \" Yesterday morning I tuned it sharp before leaving to work and when I came back in the afternoon, I checked the strings and they are still tuned to the same key I left them in the morning\", \" I played with it for at least 10 minutes just trying to learn the music from the book and I was able to play at least 4 songs without any problem\", \" This morning, I checked the note again and they stay close to the G-C-E-A range\", \" I could see this improving more as the ukelele gets used more\", \" Even if I have to tune it every day I would not have any problem with it\", \"So, for the reviews complaining about the device being out of tuned, just give the string a try to settle\", \" This are cheap string that they included here and it will take time to settle in\", \" Or you can buy a better quality string that costs around $9\", \"00 for a set\", \" Another place you can check is the tuner, make sure that it does not get pulled back when the strings tension\", \" If it would not hold its place then just grab a philips screw driver and tighten it a little\", \" That is an easy fix\", \"2\", \" The String: As I mentioned above, it is a cheap string that needs a lot of adjusting until it settles\", \" Even if you buy a good quality strings, I am sure that it will also need a few adjustment in the beginning\", \" It comes with 2 extra set in case you accidentally snap the one that is already installed\", \" The problem is that the extra set does not have a label so you have to eyeball it\", \" From some research I found online they said that the Thinnest string will be the A string\", \" The second thinnest is the E string, The thickest is the C string and the second thickest is the G string\", \" The extra string package says \\\"Gangia Brand\\\" on it so I assumed that that is the brand of the string\", \"3\", \" The Book: I just scanned the book and I could tell that it is written well for beginners\", \" The songs included progress from only needing 2 chords in the beginning and they add more chords on the succeeding lessons\", \" Each song have a chart on which chord you will use\", \"4\", \" The Case: The case will protect your ukelele from dust, water and from getting dirty while you are transporting it but will definitely protect the device from being damage in case of a drop\", \"5\", \" The DVD's and CD's: I have not tried the DVD and CD's yet but the DVD's I believe will have the lesson and the CD will have the songs on the books so you can listen to it and have an idea on how to play the songs on the book\", \" I will come back and edit this item once I

USB/Headphone plugs on the bottom of the mic, whereas my homemade version gave me fits with knob access\", \" Once you screw the Yeti into the machined shock mount base, there are teflon or maybe white delrin washers which allow you to swivel the mic easily to access the back knobs or move it toward any position, say a guest speaker with great ease\", \" The build is hefty, machined aluminum rings with stainless steel mounts and screws\", \" The elastic suspension bands are not going to fly across the room, as they do on most shock mounts, because they are not threaded on hooks, but securely fastened to brackets, then the holding screws\", \" The Radius also allows you to mount the Yeti on a boom stand, upside down, which I have always been told is the best way to mount a condenser type mic so dust and moisture (spit) does not build up near the capsules or internal electronics, it just falls, as gravity allows\", \"Does a shock mount make a difference in sound? To my ears, yes, especially if you are recording into say, a laptop on a table, the fans and hard drive are going to vibrate, coloring your overall sound with unwanted hum\", \" Although the mic stand the Yeti comes with does an O\", \"K\", \" job of dampening vibration, it is not going to give you as much isolation as the Radius, which will be noticed when the gain controls are turned up\", \" There is also the science of unwanted resonance from instruments, rooms or cabs vibrating your stands, that's why you see most professional studios using shock mounts, you just get a cleaner sound\", \" In a test, the Radius works like a charm, even from pounding on my mixing desk\", \" A 9\", \"0 earthquake is not going to cause any vibration\", \"On the down side, just to play Devils Advocate, The Radius is huge, and may nor be suitable for tight spots or portability\", \" That said, the Yeti is also a big microphone, and once mounted, may add six inches to the overall space you will need to use this setup properly\", \" Next, when you un mount the Yeti from it's built in stand, you are going to have gaping screw holes in the side of the mic\", \" I fixed that by screwing the old Yeti stand screws back into the holes, which actually looks kind of neat to me\", \" To some maybe, it will look like bolts in the Frankenstein Monsters neck, but I think it all fits together\", \" Next, smaller base microphone stands will want to tip, either angle the Yeti plus Radius back, or get a bigger stand, this is the one I have and would highly reccomend, theSamson SAMD5 MD5 Desktop Mic Stand\", \" Lastly, this mount will only work, as far as I can see, with a Blue Yeti or Blue Yeti Pro microphone, maybe some other mics will work, but not likely\", \"In conclusion, the Radius is an easy set up, works great and makes a Yeti look retro/futuristic sexy!

the UCA222)\", \" What sets these interfaces apart from the 302USB is a smaller footprint and a permanently-attached, \\\"dedicated\\\" USB cord\", \" Simply by plugging the USB cord into the USB port on my iMac I was able to record all of the broadcasts, tapes and LPs just as I had done with my old iMac (though monitoring required more cords in back--ugh!)\", \"For a committed neophyte like me, the UFO202 was probably sufficient\", \" I miss the permanently attached USB \\\"out\\\" cable and, moreover, am questioning whether I'll ever use the mixing capabilities of the 302USB, which to my eyes has a bit of a \\\"learning curve\", \"\\\" The problem for the impatient beginner begins with the instruction manual\", \" Instead of separate sections, the manual uses small, thin font and mixes English with Spanish instructions--a minor but unnecessary inconvenience\", \" (But give Behringer credit for providing a manual!)I thought I was investing in more versatility (for a modest price increase) than what the Behringer UFO/UCA line of interfaces offered me\", \" But a friend tells me that GarageBand has the capability of recording sound-on-sound\", \" My present programs (Sound Studio and Toast) can't do it, but if GB can layer 2 or more sound sources, then the question becomes whether an external mixer does it better\", \" If not, the Behringer UFO202 is not only adequate to serve my needs, but its tiny footprint makes it especially welcome on a new iMac's desk space (Apple's elimination of the internal burner gives the company \\\"thin screen\\\" bragging rights while robbing the user of both money and space--thanks to the new requirement of an external burner)\", \"Behringer has presented the best solution I've been able to find to Apple's surprising (and dubious) omissions with the latest iMac\", \" If your uses include mixing, and if you have the space (we're talking a mere inch or two), the 302USB is no doubt worth an extra ten bucks\", \" But if you have a UFO or UCA interface, your needs may already be covered\", \"I bought the smaller Behringer 302usb mixer for a small home recording setup with a budget target of &#60;$125, but had to move up to this model for and additional cost of about $12 due to the fact that the 302usb doesn't provide adequate phantom power for a Condenser Microphone (not properly disclosed by the company)\", \" The simple setup I have also includes the Behringer C-1 Condenser Microphone and a Hosa XLR cable\", \"I was looking to improve the quality of voice recordings for podcasts, interviews, etc\", \",

equipment said that Behringer makes solid items, but that I shouldn't expect much in the way of customer service\", \" He's helped me work on tweaking my setup and he finds the items I bought to be quality as expected\", \"I'm glad that I moved up to this board, even though it has a lot of features that I won't personally use\", \" I'm glad that this has two microphone inputs, if I do decided to conduct in person interviews using the board\", \" Besides the extra mic input, my son will likely put some of the additional features to use recording some music with his electric guitar and making some mixes using the features in GarageBand\", \"I have found that my son's warning is somewhat correct, at least in regards to information provided for the customer by the company both in the paperwork included in the package and on the website\", \" Since this is essentially entry level equipment, people like myself, who have little / no direct experience with sound equipment could use a little more guidance in using these projects, particularly in hooking things up to a computer, which is obviously an increasing application\", \"I couldn't find any information on the Behringer website or in the paperwork which provided guidance for a Mac user, for instance\", \" In addition, it would be nice if the manufacturer would give some basic information on such items as use of headphones for monitoring, etc\", \" when using with a computer, but they don't\", \" I've done a lot of experimentation in addition to Googling to figure out how to get things up and run\", \"So far, I'm getting quality recording results from this board\", \" I am currently using it with an RCA type cable with the input to my iMac's line-in\", \" I might ultimately try another adapter for a USB connection or Firewire, but I haven't had the opportunity to research what is possible or which of the three options provide better sound\", \" Whether I not I investigate will depend upon my needs in the future\", \"I believe I got excellent value in the equipment quality\", \" I would give 5 stars, but the manufacturer should provide more information\", \"PROS:* Small\", \" Easy to take with you or set on a small shelf\", \"* If using USB, does not need external power supply\", \" Very convenient\", \"* Easy-to-use, accessible controls\", \"* Pre-amp power, works well with condenser studio

pretty easy to overpower the computer's input and cause distortion\", \" Start the sound levels at zero and slowly bring them up until it sounds good\", \"NOTES:I purchased this for use with my studio mike, which I hadn't been able to use with my computer due to pre-amp power needs\", \" Plugged it in, worked first time, no problems\", \"This unit is very sensitive\", \" If used with a decent mike can pick up background noises from across a room\", \" With a bit of tweaking, is fine for studio work\", \" I use it for guitar/voice solo live Internet music shows\", \"Overall, I'm quite pleased with the unit\", \" The only reason I give it 4 stars rather than 5 is because it isn't perfect\", \" but then it's only fifty bucks\", \" For the price, overall quality, ease of setup, range,

recording on their computer with a studio-quality mike above the quality of the average \\\"USB microphones\\\" available on the market\", \" You not only get a pre-amp but a duo-channel stereo volume mixer in the deal\", \" Hard to beat at that price\", \"ADDENDUM: A few days after the initial review-- I just used the device on a live guitar/voice webcast\", \" No background hiss, very good, clear sound, crisp, no distortion, excellent transmission\", \" Friend recorded a video and the sound was precise and identical to the original performance\", \" Quite pleased with this little mixer/preamp\", \"HINTS AND TIPS:Two good hints on this one:* Another user and I put our heads together and realized one can use a 6-volt lantern battery (or 3 to 4 AA cells), hook them into a USB printer cable and power this via battery\", \" It works great and makes this unit PORTABLE\", \"* There are reports of this mixer interfering with the way the Windows handles sound\", \" I have found this to be true\", \" It pretty much takes over your entire sound system\", \" For some folks this will be fine\", \" For others, they may not appreciate this\", \" So what I did was uninstall the drivers, remove it from the computer USB (which seems to defeat the purpose, but wait\", \")\", \" and plugged it into one of those new portable-USB power supplies you plug right into the wall (they're available all over for between $5 and $10)\", \" This powers the system without hooking it into the USB system of your computer\", \" What this does is allow you to use the functions of the mixer without altering how Windows handles sound, the programs it uses, or causing problems with programs like Audacity\", \"You then run a LINE IN from your computer speaker output, a LINE OUT to your computer speakers or headphones, and you can still use microphones or whatever else you want\", \" This is an excellent alternative to using it as a USB device\", \" You are instead powering it from a USB wall-socket and simply using it as a quality mini-mixer (which function it performs very well)\", \" That's what I finally did and am still most happy with this device\", \"In addition by using it in this manner you pretty much eliminate the relevance of what OS you use\", \" You could use this with Windows, Mac, Linux or pretty much anything, because all you're really doing is setting it up as a mixer using standard line-in / out cables\", \" Works very well in this capacity\", \" Gotta love those new external USB power nodes\", \" : )\", \"Each bx5 d2 speaker has its own amp onboard and power supply\", \" Want a 5 channel system - buy 5 speakers and run xlr audio to each one\", \" No noise or hum\", \" Has both trs and xlr inputs - has a knob for gain control on back\", \" Most importantly each speaker has an IEC connector for power to JUST that speaker\", \" Mine sit left and right of my mixing panel using TRS outputs which copy the XLRs - those go to my Marantz PMD 580 digital recorder w/ 32 GB of datacard memory onboard and a nice set of vu meters\", \" Speakers include a foam stick on bottom to prevent buzzing against hard surfaces\", \" There is, however, no mounting point - no captive nuts or such\", \"You'll need to adopt a philosophy on gain\", \" You can crank the speaker gain to 100% and use your mixer to set the levels but ensure that your recorder gets enough signal to be in the -15 to -6 dB0 range\", \" It may be a tad loud - in that case you may want to set both speakers to their 12 oclock position which is 50% power approximately\", \"You could alternately use the mixer to run near 0 dB and turn it way down on the speakers\", \" I like to use mine to listen to talk shows before falling asleep at night so I turn the volume way down but drive them with -6 dB0 off the mixer\", \"Having a separate power supply and amp for each speaker makes for some great isolation\", \"My **FIRST** nitpick is there is no grill cover on these like

without bass bloat or exaggerated highs (i\", \"e\", \", teen EQ)\", \" The even keeled tonal signature is pleasing and easy to listen to for hours\", \" It also lacks a midrange bump, and sounds a bit recessed or laid-back compared to average earbuds or home speakers\", \" In fact the BX5 sounds similar to my Sennheiser 580HD headphones, but with less lower bass\", \" And that's a good thing for mixing as you don't want speakers that add color and/or bumps in the frequency response\", \"Unlike typical passive stereo speakers, the BX5 is powered with separate amplifiers for the tweeter and woofer, i\", \"e\", \", bi-amped\", \" This design allows for accurate reproduction as amplifiers are optimized for each driver\", \" The downside to this design is each speaker needs both input and power cables, so not convenient for living room use but not a problem for nearfield computer based editing\", \"At first the BX5 struck me as underpowered for a 70 watt rating, at least with a signal directly from my Mac Pro\", \" However, once jacked into the hotter signal from my MOTU Ultralite the true power of the BX5 was revealed\", \" It was loud and could be painfully so if cranked\", \"These are directional speakers and render placement of instruments in a stereo soundfield accurately as long as you sit in the sweet spot a couple feet out (your head should form a triangle with the two speakers)\", \" That diffuse room filling tone of home theatre speakers is MIA\", \" In fact, unlike most speakers, there is little rearwards projection\", \" Perfect for not bothering family or neighbors but bad for parties\", \" So don't buy these for standard stereo or home theatre use\", \"I mainly mix classical and acoustic guitar solo and ensemble recordings, live and multitrack, so the bass range is perfect for me\", \" The bass extends down to a clear 60Hz, so plenty ump for drop-D and drop-C tuning\", \" If you mix bass guitar and kick drum you'll want larger speakers (BX8) or a sub but these are great for guitar\", \"I'm used to mixing with neutral speakers and headphones but it would be nice if you could adjust bass, mid and highs for different room responses and taste\", \" Oddly, the PDF instructions show EQ switches for the prior version of this model but they are missing from my speakers\", \" I assume they were omitted as a cost cutting measure\", \"RFI RESISTANCE: I'm an inner city dweller and live in a high RFI area\", \" Cheap audio gear acts like a radio receiver and injects a local classic rock station into my mixes\", \" So one of the major selling points for me was M-Audio's claim of RFI shielding\", \" Luckily that was no mere marketing jive\", \" They really are well shielded against RFI\", \" Not a single wayward drum loop or DJ in my tracks, not even when cranked\", \" I can't make that claim for prior speakers I've owned\", \"HEAT: These speakers run on the warm side: the upper back is fairly warm just idling and can get hot to the touch after a long session\", \" Not egg frying hot but a wee bit uncomfortable to the fingertips\", \" It has a sensor to shut it down in case of excessive heat\", \" However I have not seen it shutdown even after all day editing sessions\", \" I live in the balmy tropics so cold weather dwellers may not see as much heat build up\", \" Not a deal breaker but it's wise to turn them off when not in use (I use a power strip so I don't have to flip two separate switches)\", \"CONSTRUCTION: These are handsome units in a blend in your your gear sort of way: the black finish matches perfectly with my black trimmed Cinema Display and MOTU Ultralite\", \" Construction appears very good with dense particle board (MDF) cabs, metal back plate (heat sink benefit) and matching plastic front molding around the drivers\", \" The cabs are covered with a satin black vinyl\", \" These monitors are petite and smaller than most speakers with the same sized bass driver\", \"The bass drivers are Kevlar with rubber surrounds (tougher than foam!) and the tweeters sport silk domes\", \" No protective grill or covers as usual for mixing monitors\", \" So the nekid drivers can be easily damaged by a careless finger or chopstick\", \"CONNECTIONS: Like most studio monitors, the BX5 comes with pro audio style jacks for 1/4 inch phone plug/TRS and XLR\", \" If you're a novice recordist or a civilian buying these for general computer use, be forewarned there are no stereo mini jacks, RCA or USB\", \" So you will need to pay extra for a set of special cables and adapters\", \" If you're an experienced recordist, you should have plenty of these cables laying around but, otherwise, be prepared to reach for your wallet\", \"One of the things I like about the BX5 is both the TRS and XLR connections are active at the same time, allowing the monitors to receive signals from two different sources without messing with cables or switches\", \" I have an Audioengine D1 DAC connected to the TRS/phone input (for iTunes, movies, games, etc\", \") while a MOTU Ultralite (for mixing & tracking) is plugged into the XLR connection\", \"LAST BLURB: Yes, the small Focal speakers I listened to were better sounding and louder than the BX5 but cost a couple toes and a month of lunches\", \" However, a perfect monitor for a home studio isn't only about a good neutral sound, but also about compactness, appearance and value\", \" And the BX5 nails all of these while still sounding pretty dad burn fine\", \"This is a pretty nifty item and it does just what it says very

things away\", \"I love this amp so much I want to buy one for every guitarist I know\", \" The only downsides are that it does not come with a cover and a footswitch\", \" But considering the price, that's understandable\", \" There's no reason to include those if most people are not going to use them\", \" You'll only want the cover and footswitch if you're playing in a band\", \"I have owned many solid state and modeling amplifiers, including a few of the Vox Valvetronix series\", \" However, this is both my first Fender amp, as well as my first true &#34;tube&#34; amp\", \" First, some clarification is needed on &#34;tube&#34; vs\", \" &#34;modeling&#34; amp\", \" The Fender Super Champ X2 is absolutely a tube amp - it has one 12AX7 and two 6V6's, and they are involved in both the preamp and power amp stages\", \" However, the amplifier has a modeling component on top of that true tube tone, which is what allows it to project different &#34;voices&#34;\", \" Contrary to what some posters have written, Channel 1 does also have some front-end modeling, except that the the model is fixed for &#34;Blackface&#34; tone and controlled by a separate volume know (no gain control)\", \" Channel 2 offers 16 different &#34;Voice&#34; presets and 10 of these model a variety of vintage Fender amplifiers, including the Tweed Deluxe, Bassman, Deluxe, Princeton, and Twin\", \" Settings 9-15 model a variety of other popular amps, including the Vox AC30 and Marshall\", \"Overall, I found the available tones to be excellent\", \" Unlike my Valvetronix, where I more or less settled on a particular setting and used it at all times, I could really see myself flipping between the different models and seeing how they respond to different guitars\", \" One thing that should be noted if you plan on changing models frequently - you may have to adjust volume, gain, bass, and treble to dial in the same amount of volume as you move from amp to amp\", \" However, I found the levels to be much more uniform in output than in other amps with a modeling component\", \" Also, the X2 does not suffer from a lot of the excess noise or &#34;hissing&#34; you hear with digital modeling amps\", \"The tones that come out of the 10&#34; speaker of the Super Champ X2 are very rich and touch-responsive, as you'd expect from a tube amp\", \" The amp has TONS of high-end sparkle, but some of the settings only start to open up if you increase the volume (true of many amps)\", \" The stock speaker, which is Fender's own design (and has a ceramic magnet, I believe), is frequently criticized as a weak point\", \" However, it is certainly passable and if you are new to tube amps (or only intend on playing at bedroom levels), you're unlikely to take issue with it\", \" The Eminence Ragin' Cajun is a commonly suggested replacement that apparently adds significant amounts of output and low end\", \" But, again, the amp is plenty loud and full-sounding for its size\", \" Better intended for home/studio use than most gigs, but it excels at what it does\", \"That brings us to the effects section and the Fender FUSE software that works with the amp via USB cable\", \" Frankly, I'm not a fan of most on-board effects with combo amplifiers\", \" I prefer to use pedals for modulation, delay, and some overdrive/distortion\", \" The good new is that the on-board reverbs (which include spring, room, hall, and a few others if you install them from the software) are quite good\", \" You can also reassign the presets to different effects\", \" So, if you want a flanger with a reverb, you can have a setting for that\", \" If you want a different type of delay mixed with a particular reverb, you can do that too\", \" The Tap Tempo button is a great modern convenience to go with those effects\", \" But, as I said, while they represent a good value for players that don't want to invest in pedals, I'm more likely to use my Boss DD-3 than the on-board delay, and so on\", \"The build quality of the Super Champ X2 is largely excellent\", \" The grill is wound tightly and with the same convincing shimmer of some of Fender's more expensive amps\", \" The amp weighs in at 24 pounds and is extremely portable with the handle on top\", \" One thing I did note, however, is that the knobs protrude and seem like they would be very easy to damage while transporting, so I will have to be careful about that\", \" Also, there are a couple of seams for the tolex material on top of the amp that look like they could have been hidden better\", \" But overall, the amp looks very well constructed\", \" I was initially concerned about the digital aspects taking away from the tube amp aesthetic, but everything is mapped to vintage-looking knobs, and from a few feet back, the amp looks just as much at home in the 60's as it does post-2000\", \"Overall, I think this is an excellent value and a quality amp that I hope to enjoy for years to come\", \" I'm only really scratching the surface of its potential, but it makes great Fender tone sound easy\", \" The Fender FUSE software could be a little more intuitive to work with, and I wish there were a better way to know what each of the Voice and F/X settings correspond to without consulting a chart\", \" But it's a great little amplifier that's all the power you'd need for hobbyists and studio recording, and it could probably handle some smaller gigs as well\", \"I have used one of the black box meter style tuners for years and struggled with it\", \" I could never quite get the fine tune I was looking for, and I have a little bit if a pitch issue trying to tune by ear\", \" These little tuners are amazing\", \" So easy to use, and portable, and cheap\", \" I have several now, one for every guitar\", \" Cheap is important, because they are made of plastic and I have had one break at the joint after a lot of use\", \" I also received one without a battery, which upset me at the time\", \" I am in Afghanistan and weird watch batteries are hard to come by\", \" If you figure they cost about as much as a fancy coffee drink they provide a lot of tuning goodness for a little money\", \"Originally I bought another Snark, and liked it well enough\", \" I'd seen this one on YouTube, and thought its little bobble head looked \", \" kinda silly\", \" But then a friend lent me his for a couple of days, and I really liked the experience of being able to glance over and see if I was in tune\", \" I was hooked\", \" I'll look silly if it lets me stay in tune\", \"The built-in metronome doesn't have a lot of volume, but it's clearly visible\", \"You also get a little baggie containing three picks, the carry bag for the tuner, and a battery\", \" Warranty runs for a year\", \" Altogether, I'm very satisfied with this tuner\", \"It seems redundant to review again except to point out I have bought more and will buy more\", \" I will have one for every instrument stored with and actually on each guitar inside it's case\", \" I have given out 5 and kept 4 - I have 11 working guitars - I need 7 more Snarks\", \" some have had their batteries run down in under a year - but I get close to 2

Get one and dont hesitate\", \"Not bad, but I had intended on leaving this on my instrument\", \" I bought a few for different basses and guitars\", \" But the switch location causes the tuner to turn on inside a gig bag (no problem with hard cases) leaving the battery dead when I took the instrument out of the case\", \" The switch SHOULD be on the side of the unit\", \" FWIW, I like my Snarks better\", \"faster and more stable tuning\", \" A near miss with the NS\", \"When I first installed these strings I wasn't too impressed\", \" They felt different under my fingers and the sound was much more tinny than I'm used to\", \" However, after a month and a half of playing, I really do love these strings\", \" I got used to the feel, the tinny sound mellowed out a little, and man do they stay in tune!Cobalt strings aren't as warm as traditional nickle strings but if you play hard rock or metal I find the gain to be more articulate\", \" Solo's pierce through the mix without becoming too shrill and muted playing has better voicing, in my opinion\", \" They're also super fast\", \" I mentioned earlier that they feel different, and they do\", \" It's not necessarily a bad different it's just slicker and not as coiled feeling\", \" Hard to describe, but if you're used to playing nickle you'll notice the difference\", \"Honestly, my favorite thing about these strings is their ability to stay in tune\", \" I went on vacation for a week, came back, picked up the guitar, expecting to have to tune it, and every single note was dead on\", \" As they age, you'll have to make a few minor tuning tweaks but its nowhere near as frequent as nickle\", \"These really are a good set of strings\", \" If you try them just make sure to give them time\", \" They get better with wear\", \"Okay\", \" just strung these up and ran them through three different amps and about 25 different pedals (metal, overdrive, echo, reverb, fuzz, etc)\", \" So keep in mind that they haven't broken in yet as I do this review\", \" But I do feel confident in what I report here\", \"They are not as nice in full warm tone as the pure nickels\", \" On the high gain metal muff, fullbore, guytone metal monster, swollen pickle, and big muff they sound really nice\", \" a lot of harmonics and output captured\", \" For that 5 stars easy\", \" I don't think they are very versatile though below the metal shredders threshold\", \" Other's may feel differently I am sure\", \" Then again, Ernie Ball even states they are very bight high output\", \" So you are getting what they say\", \"However, for a warm bluesy tone I couldn't get anywhere close to my sound like I can with the pure nickels\", \" For that 1\", \"5 star\", \" Average to 3 I guess\", \" :)\", \" Forget about the nickel wound steel all together (those are really lame)\", \" Either pure nickel or these depending on your style at the moment\", \" For shredding go cobalt\", \" for warm/woman tone go PURE nickels (that's PURE folks!!)\", \" I also really like the d'addario pures\", \"Also, these really did let full chords ring out on a heavy metal channel\", \" Hope this helps\", \"The cobalt seems like it gives the strings a silkier feeling\", \" Maybe it's just me, but that's how they come across\", \" I noticed that these strings become discolored quicker than the stock steel, but don't lose that new sound new

that it would barely be holding on to the neck\", \" If you set that one at its gentlest setting you could get it to be almost perfectly in tune even with the capo on, but set it that softly, and it would just about fall off the guitar\", \" So that is the last thing that you want to happen in the middle of a performance\", \" The Planet Waves Capo in contrast, even at the lightest setting, was still a solid grip on the neck\", \" I also noticed that the planet waves had a wider spread across the strings and therefore was less critical of the positioning in order to get it right\", \"The Schubb S1 is a well-made product, it has nicely finished metal components, but with its roller ball system of fastening, when you loosen it, for sure you're going to occasionally be dropping it in on the floor\", \" You could say that requires two hands in order to remove it\", \" The Planet Wave on the other hand is a true one-handed tool that makes it easy to remove and to put back on\", \" I tried both of these on one of my other Fender telecasters, as well as on one of my acoustics\", \" I got the same tuning results on all of them\", \" I am very critical and exact so when I say that the tuning results would change when you put on the capo you must understand, that the tuner was only moving one line\", \" Most people wouldn't even bother with that much of an adjustment but I know that there is nothing to compare to a guitar with good strings on it, and to hear the tone and the blend of those strings in perfect tune; perfect harmony rules\", \" You know that feeling when you come to the end of a great song, and you hit your last note and finish with a full chord that is perfectly in tune; there is nothing to compare to it\", \"The planet wave is a little bit bulkier and

other\", \" The way each of them mount and dismount to the guitar does make me lean more strongly to the Planet Waves\", \"I saw other reviews that commented that one type of capo provided a better tone than another type of capo\", \" Tried as I might I could not reproduce the differences that they spoke of\", \" There are so many factors affecting the tone, such as after changing the capo was a guitar body leaning a little bit more one way, then it was the last time\", \" For example was the face of the guitar a little closer to the ear range as compared to the last capo you tested that might've been projecting more from the side of the guitar\", \" I also felt that once the capo squeezes the string down the only thing that is creating tone is the fret line between it and the bridge\", \" So at least between these two I found no total differences\", \"I wanted to say that if you are using medium sized jumbo frets and high action you are really bending the string in order to fret it thereby changing the pitch\", \" I love low action with no buzzing on lighter gauge strings\", \" I'd rather dance across the top like a ballet dancer then scrub heavy gauge strings\", \" To each his own they say\", \" I just consider it important to let you know that I'm conducting this experiment with 8 gauge strings on the Tele electric and 9 gauge on the acoustic\", \" So if you're running a much heavier gauge string with lower action, you would of course have less tuning shift going on, because you could adjust the capo (and both of these have a round adjusting knob for fine-tuning) and be able to adjust it to the point where you are pressing just beyond the level of the frets and not really squeezing it all the way down on the fret board and therefore have less of a challenge in trying to keep it in tune while using a capo\", \" (Although I doubt many are setting it that way but rather squeezing it down to the fret board instead\", \") Although it is possible with heavy gauge strings that you can fine tune the pressure sufficiently that it will yield a tuned instrument while under the load of the heavier gauge strings creating a strong enough grip at this finer setting so it won't slide off of the guitar like the Shubb does at its lighter setting\", \"Of course all this is predicated upon you not re-tuning the guitar when you change the capo position\", \" That really is the only way to create a perfectly tuned instrument and that is to do a little tweaking when you change the capo position\", \" I'm sure most people ignore that and consider the ever so slightly out of tune instrument is something that is not objectionable and doesn't impede the overall quality of their performance\", \" I find on the other hand, that a guitar which is perfectly in tune takes the music to a level that is not possible no matter how little or much it is out of tune\", \"So I conclusion I find the planet waves easier-to-use and with its longer arm capable of a wider fret board, while at the same time capable of the thinner fret boards as well, as being the one that I highly recommend\", \" Notwithstanding the Shubb places a very close second, and with its slightly smaller size, it does in fact get in the way a little less than the Planet Waves\", \" All in all they both are the best of all the ones I've tried\", \"I use a variety of guitars, from an old '50s gibson acoustic to a new nylon string acoustic\", \" I expected the capo to work well on the narrower neck Gibson, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that it worked well on the 2-inch nut width guitars as well\", \" It has a spring-loaded clamping arm that can have the clamping strength increased or decreased, and this works well\", \" Above the adjustable

owned or borrowed models from Fostex and Korg going back several decades but Tascam always seems to be out in front when it comes to ease of use and value\", \" Even as the market evolved from cassette to digital, Tascam recorders have kept the same feel and ease of use\", \" I had a Boss Micro BR-80 for a while, but I found the all-menu interface annoying and difficult to use\", \" I kept forgetting the sequences to set up rhythm tracks, record, and mix down, and ended up having to repeat things over and over\", \" I soon sold it, and then replaced it with a Tascam DP-004 when that appeared on the market\", \" The Tascam wasn't really any more powerful than the Boss, and lacked the built in rhythm tracks, but it had fewer menus and more actual switches and knobs that made it more intuitive in use, and more like an actual mixing board or traditional cassette-based recorder\", \"After the DP-004 Tascam produced a follow-on six track unit and this recorder, the 8-track DP-008\", \" When it was first introduced a couple of years ago it really was a revolutionary unit\", \" There were plenty of 8-track recorders out there, but none that were that small and that inexpensive\", \" It's also more than just a DP-008 with more tracks\", \" The DP-008 has a much improved mastering ability that allows you to adjust EQ, compression, and effects individually on tracks for the mix down, while leaving the original tracks unaffected\", \" Like the DP-004, it has built in microphones and can also be used for direct stereo recording\", \" Unlike the DP-004, it comes with an external power supply in the box (a $24 option with the original 004) and can use an external battery pack\", \"I've been playing with my 008 all weekend, doing a mixture of stereo and multitrack recordings\", \" One thing I noticed right off was that there's a significant amount of noise in the monitor mix while multitracking\", \" I was afraid this would translate into noisy recordings, but the noise isn't there in the finished playback\", \" I also noticed that while the basic recording functions are more or less unchanged from those on the 004, the new mixdown functions are much more complex and required constant reference to the manual\", \" As mentioned previously, there's an awful lot of capability there and it's going to take some time to be able to use it effectively\", \" Most of that functionality is menu-based, rather than being accessibly directly from the front panel, and I have to say that's one thing I don't really care for\", \" The only input device you have to select functions and parameters and menus is a scroll wheel that's not nearly as comfortable as a knob or a mouse or touchpad\", \"Most of my recording lately has been done with various Apple platforms\", \" At home, I use Garage Band on my iMac and a USB-equipped Alesis console for input\", \" Away from home I use Garage Band on my iPad and (for ultimate portability) iPod Touch\", \" All of these platforms are much more intuitive to use than the DP-008 and much more powerful\", \" Of course, they're also a lot more expensive, and lack the built-in stereo microphones and ability to plug instruments and microphones directly in without some sort of additional interface\", \" Having XLR connectors as well as 1/4\\\" inputs is a really nice touch, something you never saw on portables from a few years ago\", \" I like the old-school approach of the DP-008 as well as the all-in-one package approach\", \"If I was just starting out in home multitrack recording and didn't have a lot to spend, I think the DP-008 might be a good choice\", \" It's really good enough to produce music for a band's first CD releases, and costs less than a decent microphone\", \" WIth 8 full tracks there's no need to do track bouncing to get four instruments and four voices down, and if you really need to, you can bounce and add a further six tracks, giving you 14 in all\", \" I don't think it's going to replace my iPod for pocket portability or my iPad for functionality (Garage Band gives me a full orchestra, keyboards and drums as well) but having the microphones and instrument preamps built in does make it much easier to set up and use for live recording\", \" It should get a lot of use at my home and elsewhere in the coming year\", \"Everything keeps improving, and getting better, faster, and cheaper, but at this price point their isn't one available that isn't a compromise in one way or another\", \" First off if you are planning on buying the US-322 don't\", \" Buy its bigger brother the US-366\", \" Getting an optical connection and additional ins and outs for such a little bit more money, as well as 192k makes it a no-brainer\", \" To get optical (on the 366 only) at this price is great, but the A/D D/A converters leave a bit to be desired\", \" On the other hand the mic pres are pretty good, have distortion ratings, THD of only 0\", \"0045% and with 24 Bit/192KHz recording make these the best sounding interfaces put out by Tascam to date\", \"What I meant by a compromise is that even with interfaces that cost 3 to 5 times this price most of them have either good mic pres, and weak clocks, or vice versa, and some work with Windows but not so well with MAC and once again vice versa, etc\", \" I researched interfaces for a long, long time, and considering non-crash reliability and a dozen other factors I finally sprung for anRME Fireface UFX USB 2\", \"0 or Firewire High Performance audio interface 30 in, 30 out\", \"

provide a review helping those who are interested in setting up this Tascam US-322 or 366 so you can save a lot of time trying to figure it out\", \" Sometimes a little help makes a huge difference in the amount of time saved\", \" So what I did was load, and register the free and included Cubase LE6 complete with activation and eLicense registration and installation as well as installing the Tascam driver, and doing updates for both\", \" I know a lot of the reviews here just downloaded a driver and used their existing DAW in order to test out the interface, and therefore they didn't need to spend much time with it\", \" I don't blame them; the shortest distance between two points is a straight line\", \" So get out a cup of coffee because installing this complete package doesn't happen in just one hour\", \" So here goes\", \"If you have Windows Vista you are probably out of luck because the system requirements list Windows XP, 7, and 8\", \" I am sure the omission of Vista is not a mistake\", \" I know myLogitech AudioHub Notebook Speakersare non-functional in my Vista laptop if you are running Windows Media Center in it as well\", \" It works in Win 7 just fine\", \" So I installed it in my desktop running Windows 7 64 bit and it gives you the option of installing in 32 or 64\", \" In addition to Cubase LE 6 it also installed AI Elements 6 as well as Agent One Content, Groove Agent One, Vintage Beat Boxes, Steinberg Drum Loop Expansion 01 which took a good amount of time to load, as well as Steinberg Halion Sonic SE 64 bit for AI Elements\", \" I then had to activate and register Cubase LE6 which involves installing the latest eLcc, creating a Steinberg account (which is free and they don't ask you for a credit card)\", \" They provide you with an activation code after you register\", \"I have an iLok for Pro Tools which is a USB device that enables you to run the program\", \" Cubase does not require that you have one, although they have an equivalent looking device, but fortunately they have a software based equivalent\", \" They do this with an eLicense which you will then update to version 6\", \"5\", \"4\", \"1122\", \" There is an

5 foot USB printer style cable\", \" You will need to install the driver disc before connecting it to your computer\", \" Windows 7 recognizes it but fails to automatically load a driver\", \" So install the driver off of the disc first, and then do the update\", \" It took at least 15 minutes to do that update\", \" What flashed on the screen was 154 megabytes and then all you see is an install screen with a scrolling series of round objects moving\", \" At first it says, \\\"This is going to take a long time\\\", and they were exactly right\", \" It almost tempts you to think something is wrong, because nothing is happening other than the scrolling, and then finally after ten minutes or so a dialogue box comes up and says, \\\"Do you want to install?\\\" and you click continue, and then it comes up again in another minute, and this happens a few times, and then finally it changes over to an installation finished box\", \" (I have Verizon FIOS and usually download huge amount of data in a flash)\", \" Then you reboot\", \"Now this is important\", \" Plug the US-322 directly into an available USB 2\", \"0 port and not into a hub, even if it is a powered hub\", \" It simply won't work\", \" I tried it and the light wouldn't even come on indicating USB\", \" When I went direct the interface lit up and it worked\", \" The manuals also warn you not to use it with USB 1\", \"1\", \" The US-322 comes with a printed Quick Start Guide\", \" There is also an owner's manual for both the Interface, and Cubase that are available either on the DVD, or by Googling the same and they come up as a PDF download\", \" If you are new to setting up interfaces be prepared to do a good deal of reading\", \" There is a driver to choose, input and output settings, as well as going into Windows Control Panel/Sound in order to choose the interface for playback, and recording\", \" If you're new to these kinds of setups just take your time, and don't be dismayed if something doesn't work\", \" All it takes is for one button to get pushed and Wahlah you have sound\", \" For example in Cubase there is a monitoring button without it you won't get any sound from the headphones\", \" If all else fails you can go to the Tascam web site by Googling Tascam US-322 and then click on the support tab, and they have a \\\"you pay for it\\\" phone call number in order to
